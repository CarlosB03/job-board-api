## API Endpoints
### Authentication

#### POST /api/auth/register
Register a new user (company or jobseeker).
Request body example:
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "yourpassword",
  "role": "COMPANY"
}

#### POST /api/auth/login
Login and receive a JWT token.
Request body example:
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}

### Jobs
#### GET /api/jobs
Get jobs with optional filtering and field selection.
Query parameters:
company — filter by company name
location — filter by job location
fields — comma-separated fields to include in response (e.g., title,company,pay)

#### POST /api/jobs (COMPANY only)
Create a new job listing.
Requires Authorization: Bearer <token> header.
Request body example:
{
  "title": "Frontend Developer",
  "company": "Nvidia",
  "jobDescription": "Develop user interfaces",
  "requirements": "React, JavaScript",
  "responsibilities": "Implement new features",
  "pay": "$120,000",
  "location": "Remote",
  "skills": "React, Tailwind"
}

#### PUT /api/jobs/:id (COMPANY only)
Update a job listing partially or fully.
Requires Authorization: Bearer <token> header.
Request body can include any fields to update, for example:
{
  "pay": "$130,000"
}

---

## Notes
Use the JWT token returned on login in the Authorization header as Bearer <token> to access protected endpoints.
JOBSEEKER role users can only perform GET requests on jobs.
COMPANY role users have full CRUD access on their own job listings.
Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.
Proper error messages and HTTP status codes are returned for validation, authorization, and server errors.

---

## Testing
Use Postman or any API client:
Register a user (company or jobseeker).
Login to get the JWT token.
Use the token for authorized requests to create, update, or delete jobs (COMPANY only).
Use GET requests freely to list or filter jobs.
